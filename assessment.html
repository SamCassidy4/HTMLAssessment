      We are lucky to live in a glorious age that gives us everything we could ask for as a human race. What more could you need when you have meat covered in cheese nestled between bread as a complete meal.

      From smashed patties at Shake Shack to Glamburgers at Honky Tonk, thereâ€™s a little something for everyone. Some burgers are humble, and some are ostentatious, and you just have to try them all to figure out what you want.

    <strong> Personal text</strong>
    I'm going to write my own text here. I kept trying to find something fun to post here but there wasn't much in terms of length. I figured I'd just talk about my experience and why I'm here. I actually graduated college with a psychology degree with an emphasis in mind, brain, and behavior. My goal was to be a therapist or a doctor. During my time in college however, I  became employed as a chef. During my time as a chef I realized that if I had to deal with people's abusive attitudes with regards to their health rather than their food. I wasn't going to have a good time. Unfortunately I had made this decision in my senior year. I had to make a career pivot pretty quickly. That's when a friend of mine recommended Skill Distillery.
